# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This is a classic arcade game, similar to Frogger. The goal of the game is for the player to reach the water (top), without colliding into any of the bug enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block. Once a player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
